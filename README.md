### The `SMALL` print
The goal of today's workshop is to develop a fast iterative GPU-based solver for elliptic equations and use it to:
1. Solve a steady state subsurface flow problem (geothermal operations, injection and extraction of fluids)
2. Invert for the subsurface permeability having a sparse array of fluid pressure observations

We will not use any "black-box" tooling but rather try to develop concise and performant codes (300 loc max) that execute on GPUs. We will also use automatic differentiation (AD) capabilities and the differentiable Julia stack to automatise the calculation of the adjoint solutions in the gradient-based inversion procedure.

The main Julia packages we will rely on are:
- [CUDA.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/CUDA.jl) for GPU computing on Nvidia GPUs
- [Enzyme.jl](https://github.com/EnzymeAD/Enzyme.jl) for AD on GPUs
- [CairoMakie.jl](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl) for plotting
- [Optim.jl](https://github.com/JuliaNLSolvers/Optim.jl) to extend the vanilla gradient-descent procedure

Most of the workshop is based on "hands-on". Changes to the scripts are incremental and should allow to build up complexity throughout the day. Blanked-out scripts for most of the steps are available in the [scripts](/scripts/) folder. Solutions scripts will be shared at some point in the [scripts_solutions](/scripts_solutions) folder.

## VSCode on Noctua 2
Before we start, let's make sure that everyone can remote connect over SSH to a GPU node on the **Noctua 2** supercomputer we will use today.

Let's go back to the email titled "**SCALES workshop - login credentials**" in order to access the HackMD doc to go through the "**VSCode on the Compute Node (on Monday only)**" procedure.

If all went fine, you should be able to execute the following command in your Julia REPL:
```julia-repl
julia> include("visu_2D.jl")
```
which will produce this figure:

## Julia for HPC

Some words on the Julia at scale effort, the Julia HPC packages, and the overall Julia for HPC motivation (two language barrier)

### The (yet invisible) cool stuff
Today, we will develop code that:
- Runs on graphics cards using the Julia language
- Uses a fully local and iterative approach (scalability)
- Retrieves automatically the Jacobian Vector Product (JVP) using automatic differentiation (AD)
- (All scripts feature about 300 lines of code)

Too good to be true? Hold on ðŸ™‚ ...

### Why to still bother with GPU computing in 2023
- It's around for more than a decade
- It shows massive performance gain compared to serial CPU computing
- First exascale supercomputer, Frontier, is full of GPUs

### Performance that matters
![cpu_gpu_evo](./docs/cpu_gpu_evo.png)

Taking a look at a recent GPU and CPU:
- Nvidia Tesla A100 GPU
- AMD EPYC "Rome" 7282 (16 cores) CPU

| Device         | TFLOP/s (FP64) | Memory BW TB/s | Imbalance (FP64)     |
| :------------: | :------------: | :------------: | :------------------: |
| Tesla A100     | 9.7            | 1.55           | 9.7 / 1.55  Ã— 8 = 50 |
| AMD EPYC 7282  | 0.7            | 0.085          | 0.7 / 0.085 Ã— 8 = 66 |

**Meaning:** we can do about 50 floating point operations per number accessed from main memory.
Floating point operations are "for free" when we work in memory-bounded regimes.

ðŸ‘‰ Requires to re-think the numerical implementation and solution strategies

Unfortunately, the cost of evaluating a first derivative $âˆ‚A / âˆ‚x$ using finite-differences:
```julia
q[ix] = -D * (A[ix+1] - A[ix]) / dx
```
consists of:
- 1 read (`A`) + 1 write (`q`) => $2 Ã— 8$ = **16 Bytes transferred**
- 2 (fused) addition and multiplication => **2 floating point operations**

ðŸ‘‰ assuming $D$, $âˆ‚x$ are scalars, $q$ and $A$ are arrays of `Float64` (read from main memory)

### Performance that matters - an example
Not yet convinced? Let's have a look at an example.

Let's assess how close from memory copy (1355 GB/s) we can get solving a 2D diffusion problem on an Nvidia Tesla A100 GPU.

$$ âˆ‡â‹…(D âˆ‡ C) = \frac{âˆ‚C}{âˆ‚t} $$

ðŸ‘‰ Let's test the performance using a simple [scripts/perftest.jl](scripts/perftest.jl) script.

### Why to still bother with GPU computing in 2023
Because it is still challenging. Why?
- Very few software uses it efficiently.
- It requires to rethink the solving strategy as non-local operations will kill the fun.
